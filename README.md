# diabetic_retinopathy_classification
Diabetic individuals experience ophthalmological distress known as diabetic retinopathy as a result of blood, hemorrhages formed in retina's sensitive area. Because of increase in blood sugar, vascular blockage occurs. This causes the growth of new vessels, which results in the development of mesh-like structures. Ophthalmologists must evaluate the branching retinal vasculature in order to provide an accurate diagnosis. Pre-processing is applied to eye images before segmentation. The maximal curvature technique, that uses Hessian matrixâ€™s Eigenvalues. Following that, segmentation is carried out to improve and remove incorrectly segmented sections. When compared to healthy people, those with diabetes or affected showed a substantially higher proliferation of optical nerves. For classification purposes, we trained the classifier using a convolution neural network (CNN). Convolution and pooling layers make up the CNN's classification architecture for the two classes. Dataset used DIARETDB1. Comparing suggested algorithm to more established methods, experimental findings demonstrate superior results. When tested on the DIARETDB1 dataset, the model produced results with a precision and accuracy of 97.2% and 98.2%, respectively.
